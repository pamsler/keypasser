# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We **do not** publish a `latest` tag. Releases are tagged with semantic versions
(`vX.Y.Z`). Security fixes are provided for the **most recent tagged release**
(the highest `vX.Y.Z`). Older tags are best-effort only.

| Releases                                   | Supported        |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Highest SemVer tag (current `vX.Y.Z`)      | ✅ Supported     |
| Any older tag                               | ⚠️ Best-effort   |


## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please **do not open public issues** for security problems.

- Report privately via **GitHub Security Advisory**:  
  https://github.com/pamsler/keypasser/security/advisories/new
- Include steps to reproduce, affected versions, environment, and any PoCs.
- We will acknowledge receipt within **72 hours** and keep you updated on progress.
- Once fixed, we’ll coordinate a disclosure and release notes.

Thank you for helping keep KeyPasser secure.
